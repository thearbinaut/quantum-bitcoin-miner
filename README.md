# Quantum-Inspired Bitcoin Miner

This project implements a quantum-inspired algorithm for Bitcoin mining. It's designed to demonstrate the concept of quantum-inspired optimization in the context of cryptocurrency mining.

## Files

- `quantum_inspired_miner.py`: Implements the core quantum-inspired mining algorithm.
- `bitcoin_quantum_miner.py`: Interfaces with the Bitcoin network and manages the mining process.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (TODO: Create this file)
3. Set up a Bitcoin Core node and ensure it's fully synced.

## Usage

Run the miner with:

```
python bitcoin_quantum_miner.py
```

## Note

This is a proof-of-concept and is not intended for actual Bitcoin mining. CPU mining is not competitive in the current Bitcoin network.

## TODO

- Implement full integration of quantum-inspired algorithm with Bitcoin mining process.
- Add configuration options for fine-tuning the mining process.
- Improve error handling and logging.
- Create a requirements.txt file.
